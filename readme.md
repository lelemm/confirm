# What is this?
Basically this is just an app that takes confirmation from user before calling a link

# Motivation?
I have some webhooks from N8N that are sent to Gotify notification, so I can take actions. Sometimes I misclick the link and the workflow is executed. I created this so I must confirm that I want to run that webhook
